"""
so i just watched the lectures of numpy and want to do some practice.

Give me Some Questions 5 Basics,5 Intermediate 5 advanced level regarding the numpy 

also in advanced level give some hints but not the exact solution.

Sure! Here are some numpy practice questions categorized into Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced levels:

**Basics:**

1. Create a numpy array of zeros of shape (3, 4).
2. Create a numpy array of ones of shape (2, 3).
3. Create a numpy array of shape (3, 3) with random integers ranging from 1 to 10.
4. Create a numpy array containing the numbers 1 to 10.
5. Reshape the array from question 4 into a shape of (2, 5).

**Intermediate:**

6. Create a 5x5 identity matrix using numpy.
7. Given two numpy arrays `arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])` and `arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])`, concatenate them horizontally.
8. Given a numpy array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, reverse the array.
9. Create a numpy array with 10 equally spaced values between 0 and 1.
10. Given a numpy array `arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])`, extract all odd numbers from the array.

**Advanced (with hints):**

11. Given a numpy array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, compute the square of each element without using loops. (Hint: Look into numpy's vectorized operations.)
12. Create a 2D numpy array of shape (5, 7) with 1's on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere. (Hint: Consider using numpy's `diag` function.)
13. Given a numpy array `arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, calculate the cumulative sum of elements. (Hint: Look into numpy's `cumsum` function.)
14. Given a 2D numpy array `arr`, swap its rows such that the first row becomes the last row and vice versa. (Hint: Think about slicing.)
15. Implement the dot product of two numpy arrays without using numpy's built-in dot function. (Hint: Recall the definition of the dot product and how it can be computed using element-wise multiplication and summing.)

These questions should give you a good range of practice with numpy! Let me know if you need more explanation or hints for any of them.
