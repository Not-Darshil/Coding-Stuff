so i just watched the lectures of pandas of python and want to do some practice.
Give me Some Questions 5 Basics,5 Intermediate 5 advanced level regarding the pandas 
also in advanced level give some hints but not the exact solution.


Sure, here are some pandas practice questions for you:

**Basics:**
1. Load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and display the first 5 rows.
2. Select a single column from a DataFrame.
3. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a numerical column in a DataFrame.
4. Filter rows in a DataFrame based on a condition (e.g., values greater than a certain threshold).
5. Create a new column in a DataFrame by performing arithmetic operations on existing columns.

**Intermediate:**
1. Group a DataFrame by a categorical column and calculate the mean of another column within each group.
2. Merge two DataFrames based on a common column.
3. Reshape a DataFrame from wide to long format (or vice versa) using the `melt()` or `pivot()` function.
4. Use the `apply()` function to perform a custom operation on each row or column of a DataFrame.
5. Handle missing values in a DataFrame by either dropping rows with missing values or filling them with a specific value.

**Advanced:**
1. Perform time series analysis on a DataFrame containing a datetime column (e.g., calculate rolling mean or sum over a specific time window).
   (Hint: Look into the `resample()` function for downsampling or upsampling time series data.)
2. Implement a custom function to apply element-wise to a DataFrame and use it efficiently with `apply()` or `applymap()`.
   (Hint: Utilize vectorized operations or the `numba` library for performance optimization.)
3. Perform advanced indexing and selection on a DataFrame, such as using boolean indexing with multiple conditions or using `loc` and `iloc` for label-based and integer-based indexing, respectively.
   (Hint: Break down complex operations into smaller steps for better understanding and debugging.)
4. Optimize memory usage of a large DataFrame by converting appropriate columns to more memory-efficient data types (e.g., integers to unsigned integers, floats to floats with lower precision).
   (Hint: Use the `info()` function to inspect the data types and memory usage of each column.)
5. Handle categorical data efficiently in a DataFrame by converting categorical columns to the appropriate data type and performing operations such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   (Hint: Explore the `astype()` function and the `pd.get_dummies()` function for categorical encoding.)

These questions should provide a good mix of challenges at various levels of proficiency with pandas. Feel free to ask for further clarification or hints if needed!
